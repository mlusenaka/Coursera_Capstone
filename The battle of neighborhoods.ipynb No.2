It is an essential premise for human existence. However, different states have different food and food habits. That is because they have different cultures, especially food culture. Chinese cuisine is extremely diverse with wide regional variations, and it is not uncommon for even Chinese people themselves to find the cuisine from another region to be completely foreign to them.\n\n## Problem\nThere is no denying that some Chinese cuisine consist of food considered exotic. For a new visitor in Beijing who does not want to experiment with Chinese cuisine, how can they get support to list and visualize Beijing districts that fit their needs in terms of culinary/ food venues since there is also too much information on the web because everybody\u2019s got their own take of where to go and it\u2019s all so fragmented that you have to assemble it yourself especially if you\u2019re conservative, and interested in non-touristy recommendations.\n"

For this, I will use requests and Beautifulsoup4 library to create a data-frame containing name of the districts of Beijing as the basis for the neighborhood names and associated location, and get the coordinates for the major districts using geocoder class of Geopy client.\n\n## Restaurants in each neighbourhood of Beijing:\nData source: Foursquare APIs\nDescription : By using this API we will get all the venues in each neighbourhood. I will filter these venues to get only restaurants.\n"
